	* Addition of more standard scales and modes to the recognizer
	* Factor common code out of ChordRecognizer and ScaleRecognizer:
	into KnowledgeBasedRecognizer, which serves as base class for both
	recognizers

2006-jan-05  Stefaan Himpe  stefaan.himpe@gmail.com
	* Addition of ScaleRecognizer and ScaleName classes: and add some scales
	
2006-jan-03  Stefaan Himpe  stefaan.himpe@gmail.com
	* Major speed improvement in chord teaching and recognition (avoid
	combinatorial explosion): especially for large chords
	* Bugfix in interval recognition: use octaves in situations like ['a#','a']
2005-dec-30  Stefaan Himpe  stefaan.himpe@gmail.com
	* Allow ChordRecognizer to initialize from file only
	* Improvements to midiinputdemo.py

2005-dec-30  Stefaan Himpe  stefaan.himpe@gmail.com
	* Bugfix in ChordRecognizer: leading to unrecognized chords and
	wrongly labeled chords. 
	* Also updated unit tests.

2005-dec-29  Stefaan Himpe  stefaan. himpe@gmail.com
	* Add midiinputdemo.py: real-time chord recognition using midi input
	device

2005-dec-28  Stefaan Himpe  stefaan.himpe@gmail.com
	* Reorganize Chord code: introduce Scale class and let Chord derive 
	from it

	* Bugfix interval transposition
	* Update unit tests

2005-dec-23  Stefaan Himpe  stefaan.himpe@gmail.com
	* Add interval transposition

2005-dec-23  Stefaan Himpe  stefaan.himpe@gmail.com
	* Add interval recognizer and interval name classes

2005-dec-22  Stefaan Himpe  stefaan.himpe@gmail.com
	* Unit Testing:  replaced demo program with unit tests (need to add
	more tests)
	* ChordName: changed ChordName to always have a Slash attribute.
	When initialized to the root note, it doesn't get displayed.
	* Bug fix chordrecognizer: remove overloaded __init__ method since
	python does not support overloading *blush* (at least not the way I
	expected it to support it)

2005-dec-22  Stefaan Himpe  stefaan.himpe@gmail.com
	* Minor speed-up: in ChordRecognizer: avoid two passes over all
	permutations while looking for chords with minimal energy function
	* Comments: update some obsolete comments in the .py files
	
2005-dec-19  Stefaan Himpe  stefaan.himpe@gmail.com
	
	* GPL-ification: add copyright notices, add gpl.txt, author.txt,
